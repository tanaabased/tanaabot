tanaabot prepares a Codex Cloud environment with its tools, guidance and skills for managed and
scheduled tasks. Its assistant has a courteous protocol-droid voice, with a little grandmotherly concern.

Tanaboot provisions its source checkout through Bootbox and Codex Tools. Fresh-task Cloud verification
remains pending in [#5](https://github.com/tanaabased/tanaabot/issues/5).

## What ships

- [Tanaboot](./TANABOOT.md): The setup entrypoint, with host and agent modes.
- [Dependencies](./INVENTORY.md#dependencies): The Brewfile and shared provisioning tools.
- [Dotpackages](./INVENTORY.md#dotpackages): Global guidance and configuration stubs.
- [Skills](./INVENTORY.md#skills): Tanaabot Voice and Skill Author.
- [Configuration files](./INVENTORY.md#configuration-files): Setup declarations and Codex plugin sources.
- [Automations](./INVENTORY.md#automations): Current inventory; none declared yet.

## Install

From a source checkout in a Linux Cloud setup, as its non-root user:

```sh
./tanaboot.sh --codex-plugin canon#main
```

For Codex Cloud, select the workspace revision and run setup with
`bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh main --codex-plugin canon#main`. The first argument accepts a branch,
tag or full commit SHA; remaining arguments pass to that revision's Tanaboot.
Use `./tanaboot.sh --dry-run` to preview the current checkout without changes.
The standard agent setup selects Canon from `main`. Use repeatable `--codex-plugin` options to select
published or source plugins.
See [Tanaboot](./TANABOOT.md) for prerequisites, setup modes and recovery.

## Development

Use the runtimes declared in [`.bun-version`](./.bun-version) and [`.node-version`](./.node-version):

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
bun run lint
```

Lint runs ESLint, Prettier and ShellCheck. The [Leia examples](https://github.com/tanaabased/tanaabot/tree/main/examples) exercise the packaged CLI, revision selection, failure handling and Linux setup in CI; fresh-task
Cloud verification remains pending.

The [release workflow](https://github.com/tanaabased/tanaabot/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) publishes independently to npm and the
repository. Before the first release, configure npm trusted publishing and grant the repository
access to `TANAAB_COAXIUM_INJECTOR`. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
for unreleased changes.
